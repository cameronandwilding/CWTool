 * When providing plugin annotation, properties whose values are displayed in
 * the user interface should be made translatable. Much the same as how user
 * interface text elsewhere is wrapped in t() to make it translatable, in plugin
 * annotation, wrap translatable strings in the @ Translation() annotation.
 * For example:
 * @code
 *   title = @ Translation("Title of the plugin"),
 * @endcode
 * Remove spaces after @ in your actual plugin - these are put into this sample
 * code so that it is not recognized as annotation.
 *
 * It is also possible to provide a context with the text, similar to t():
 * @code
 *   title = @ Translation("Bundle", context = "Validation"),
 * @endcode
 * Other t() arguments like language code are not valid to pass in. Only
 * context is supported.
